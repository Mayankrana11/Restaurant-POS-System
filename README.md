# 🍜 Haru no Yorokobi — Restaurant Tablet Ordering & Staff Dashboard System

Haru no Yorokobi is a **full-stack, tablet-based restaurant ordering system** that simulates a real in-restaurant POS workflow.  
Customers place orders on a tablet at their table, select payment methods, and staff manage orders through a live dashboard.

This project follows **production-style frontend–backend separation**, snapshot-based order modeling, and real-world POS logic.

## 🚀 Features

### Customer (Tablet Interface)
- Tablet-optimized UI (iPad-style layout)
- Browse menu by category (Ramen, Sushi, Bento, etc.)
- Add/remove items from cart
- Table selection per order
- Multiple payment methods:
  - QR / UPI
  - Card
  - Cash
- Order confirmation screen with backend-generated Order ID

### Staff Dashboard
- Live order feed (auto-refresh)
- Displays:
  - Table number
  - Order ID
  - Ordered items with quantities
  - Total bill amount
  - Payment method & payment status
- Order lifecycle management:
  - NEW → ONGOING → COMPLETED
- Visual distinction between **PAID** and **UNPAID** orders
- Scrollable dashboard for high order volume

## 🧠 System Architecture

```
Customer Tablet (React)
        ↓ REST API
Backend Server (Node + Express)
        ↓
In-memory Order Store
        ↓
Staff Dashboard (React)
```

### Design Principles Used
- Snapshot-based order storage (menu changes don’t affect old orders)
- Backend as single source of truth
- Stateless frontend routing
- Clear separation of concerns

## 🔄 Order Flow (End-to-End)

1. Customer selects items from menu
2. Cart is converted into **item snapshots** (name, price, qty)
3. Customer selects table number
4. Payment method chosen (QR / Card / Cash)
5. Order sent to backend:
   - Payment status determined
   - Order ID generated server-side
6. Staff dashboard fetches and displays order
7. Staff updates order status (ONGOING → COMPLETED)

---

## 💳 Payment Logic

| Method | Payment Status |
|------|---------------|
| QR   | PAID          |
| Card | PAID          |
| Cash | UNPAID        |

Payment status is stored independently from order lifecycle status.

## 🧑‍🍳 Order Lifecycle

```
NEW → ONGOING → COMPLETED
```

This allows staff to manage kitchen flow realistically.
